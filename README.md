# sudoku-ls
A LiveScript sudoku solver, based on Peter Norvig's famous constraint-based implementation.

# Usage
Require the solve function from sudoku.js, and feed it sudoku puzzles as a list of 9 strings, with the blank spaces marked as 0. See my [solution](https://github.com/yrmj/euler-ls/blob/master/96.ls) to Project Euler problem 96 for an example.
